                                            Module 3 - Arrays, String and String buffer      

                                            
                                        Write the following programs using Arrays and Strings  

1. Write a program to read a string from user.  The application has to pass the string to another function which should be implemented with a logic to reverse each word of the given string.   The string is composed of words separated by a space.
   
2. Imagine you're designing a music player application. You have an array named playlist that stores song titles as strings. You want to write code that takes a specific song title as input and determines its position (index) within the playlist.   
Write a program for the above requirement

3. Imagine you're building a simple text editor. You want to write a method that takes a user's sentence as input and reverses the order of the words within the sentence. The method should create a new reversed sentence using a StringBuffer.  
Implement the code using String Buffer.


5. Write a program to find the minimum value in a 2D integer array.


6. Imagine you're working on a program to analyze text messages. You have a 1D character array named message that stores a user's text message. You want to write a method that takes this message array and returns the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) found within the message (case-insensitive).
